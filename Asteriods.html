        <h1>Preview</h1>
        <p>Asteroids are rocks in space that never quite made it as planets. 
        Astronomers think that our solar system began as a cloud of gas and dust. 
    Gravity pulled parts of the cloud together to make the Sun and the nine panets. 
      Astronomers think that the asteriods formed in that cloud but never grew large enough to be planets.

    <h1>How Big Are Asteriods</h1>
    <p>There are thousand of asteriods, and they come in all sizes.The biggest asteriod ever found is called Ceres. Ceres is more than 600 miles(1,000 kilometer) wide. Astronomers have found about 200 aseriods that are more than 60 miles(100 kilometer) across. All the other asteriods are much smaller. Some are only a few feeet wide. <br>
    Astronomers wonder if once there were just a few big asteriod. The big asteriods may have crashed into each other.
The crashes would have broken them into smaller pieces, making all the asteriods we see today. <br>
Some asteriods are round. Some asteriods are long and bumpy. Some Asteriods even have tiny moons going around them.

<h1>Where Are Asteriods In Space</h1>
<p> Asteriods go around or orbit, the Sun just like planets. Most asteriods orbit in the asteriod belt. the asteriod belt is farther ot from the Sun than Earth's orbit. It lies between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. <br>
Sometimes asteroids change orbits and move out of the asteriod belt. These asteriods cross the orbits of planets as the planets go around the Sun. A few cross Earth's orbit.

<h1>How Do Astronomers Study Asteriods?</h1>
<p> Asteriods are normaly too small and far away to see with your eyes.
    Astronomers study asteriods with telescopes. They have also sent spacecraft for close-up looks at several asteriods. A spacecraft named Near-Earth Asteriod Rendezvous(NEAR) Shoemaker actally landed on an asteriod in 2001. <br>
    Astronomers have found that mot asteriods are made mainly of stone.
    Some asteriods are mostly made of metals. Astronomers think that asteriods made of metal must have melted at some time in the past. The liquid metal clumped together at the center together at the center of the asteriod. Most of the rocky part later broke off from the asteriod, leaving the metal behind. What melted these metal asteriods is stil a mystery. <hr> </p>
    <h1>Could An Asteriod Hit Earth</h1>
    <p>Astronomers think that several thousand asteriods have orbits that might one day make them strike Earth. Asteroids have certainly hit Earth in the past. People have found thousands of meteorites(stones from space) that have crashed into Earth. Most meteorites are pieces of asteriods. There is a giant crater (hole in the ground) in Arizona that is more than half a mile (about a kilometer) wide! The Crater was formed when a meteor crashed into Earth. <br>
    An asteriod crashing into Earth may have killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Scientists have found a big meterorite crater around Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. they think the asteriod that created this crater may have killed the dinosaurs. After the asteriod crashed,a huge cloud of dustwould have darkened Earth. It could have become very cold on Earth, and plants that dinosaurs ate might have died. As the plant-eating dinosaurs died from lack of food, meat-eating would have run out of food and died as well. <br>
 Scientist are setting up a system to warn us of asteriods coming towards Earth. If they find one they mignt be able to blow up the asteriod. They might be able to attach a rocket to the asteroid and push it just enough to miss Earth.
